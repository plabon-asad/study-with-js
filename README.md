### Javascript can't sort properly as itself

```javascript
const nums = [10, 5, 20, 6, 11]
nums.sort(); //Output: [10, 11, 20, 5, 6]

function accending(x, y) {
    return x > y ? 1 : -1
}

function decending(x, y) {
    return x < y ? 1 : -1
}

//now you can call it
nums.sort(accending) //[5, 6, 10, 11, 20]

nums.sort(decending) //[20, 11, 10, 6, 5]
```
